        <p>Let’s say you’re a bird.</p>
        <p>You’ve been flying because you believe that somewhere ahead, there might be a place meant for you to land.</p>
        <p>But one day, you realize: the farther you fly, the less certain everything becomes.</p>
        <p>There’s no sign saying, “Here’s a place for you.”</p>
        <p>No perch waiting.</p>
        <p>Or worse - the place itself might be rejecting you.</p>
        <p>And yet, you cannot stop.</p>
        <p>Not for lack of will, not for lack of weariness, but because to pause - when nothing is certain - would be to accept that every beat of your wings, every mile flown, was in vain.</p>
        <p>And to finally rest, you hope - at the very least - for the smallest mercy from that uncertainty: a whisper, a word, anything to say Stop.</p>
        <p>But nothing comes.</p>
        <p>By then, would you still keep flying?</p>
        <p>How long could you keep believing when there’s nothing tangible to hold on to?</p>
        <p>Do you believe that hard work always bears its reward?</p>
        <p>So tell me — have you ever seen me flying toward you?</p>
        <p>(It’s just a coincidence, a tragic incident, that the perch exists and the bird sees it but I had to articulate the bird's crash because it did happen inevitably and it was never your burden to carry)</p>

        <p>There’s no particular food I crave, nor is there a specific person I intensely miss.</p>
        <p>Every time it rains, I get wet. Just as I suspected — that once I bought one, it probably wouldn’t rain — well, look, the rain truly hasn’t come.</p>
        <p>For no reason, sometimes I remember a place: Yangon’s Night Bazaar.</p>
        <p>The fried beehoon with red sauce, the pork offal skewers from KyiMyinDaing…</p>
        <p>I feel a kind of longing, or something like it. I don’t even understand myself.</p>
        <p>It’s true. The things I don’t know for sure have multiplied.</p>
        <p>Do I love this person? Am I even capable of love? Things like that, too.</p>
        <p>And all that talk about “don’t reach for flowers you can’t grasp”… what is that?</p>
        <p>I’ve never felt that I could truly reach anything. Since I never got to experience having things, I never had a standard for what is within reach and what isn’t.</p>
        <p>The only standard I had was that if I wanted something, I’d at least try to get it.</p>
        <p>The other day, I tried a new food — something deep-fried, coated in batter.</p>
        <p>It was quite delicious, and I liked it, but I couldn’t figure out what kind of meat was stuffed inside.</p>
        <p>Struggling for a long time, I finally realized: it was fish.</p>
        <p>Ah… I had forgotten. I’d even forgotten what fish tastes like. It’s not that I couldn’t remember; I had made myself forget.</p>
        <p>Wanting to swim to the other shore, I ended up deep under the ocean floor.</p>
        <p>The calluses on my feet — no matter how many times I clip them with nail clippers — they just keep growing back.</p>
        <p>Is life itself this hard already, or is there someone making it harder?</p>
        <p>If there is, cut them off. Cut off friends even. Cut off lovers either.</p>
        <p>For almost a whole lifetime, I never caught a single fish.</p>
        <p>Look — just when I was about to catch one, the whole universe was pulled up, and my fishing rod bent and became a rainbow.</p>
        <p>It was me who got caught, after all.</p>
