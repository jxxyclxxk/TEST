    <h2>My Horizon For Ever</h2>
    <div class="date">October 19, 2025</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Let’s say you’re a bird.</p>
      <p>You’ve been flying because you believe that somewhere ahead, there might be a place meant for you to land.</p>
      <p>But one day, you realize: the farther you fly, the less certain everything becomes.</p>
      <p>There’s no sign saying, “Here’s a place for you.”</p>
      <p>No perch waiting.</p>
      <p>Or worse - the place itself might be rejecting you.</p>
      <p>And yet, you cannot stop.</p>
      <p>Not for lack of will, not for lack of weariness,
      but because to pause - when nothing is certain - would be to accept that every beat of your wings, every mile flown, was in vain.</p>
      <p>And to finally rest, you hope - at the very least - for the smallest mercy from that uncertainty: a whisper, a word, anything to say Stop.</p>
      <p>But nothing comes.</p>
      <p>By then, would you still keep flying?</p>
      <p>How long could you keep believing when there’s nothing tangible to hold on to?</p>
      <p>Do you believe that hard work always bears its reward?</p>
      <p>So tell me — have you ever seen me flying toward you?</p>
      <p>( It’s just a coincidence, a tragic incident, that the perch exists and the bird sees it but I had to articulate the bird's crash because it did happen inevitably and it was never your burden to carry )</p>

    <h2>The Fish I Never Caught</h2>
    <div class="date">September 15, 2023</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There’s no particular food I crave,
      nor is there a specific person I intensely miss.</p>
      <p>Every time it rains, I get wet.
      Just as I suspected — that once I bought one, it probably wouldn’t rain —
      well, look, the rain truly hasn’t come.</p>
      <p>For no reason, sometimes I remember a place:
      Yangon’s Night Bazaar.</p>
      <p>The fried beehoon with red sauce,
      the pork offal skewers from KyiMyinDaing…</p>
      <p>I feel a kind of longing, or something like it.
      I don’t even understand myself.</p>
      <p>It’s true.
      The things I don’t know for sure have multiplied.</p>
      <p>Do I love this person?
      Am I even capable of love?
      Things like that, too.</p>
      <p>And all that talk about “don’t reach for flowers you can’t grasp”…
      what is that?</p>
      <p>I’ve never felt that I could truly reach anything.
      Since I never got to experience having things,
      I never had a standard for what is within reach and what isn’t.</p>
      <p>The only standard I had was that if I wanted something,
      I’d at least try to get it.</p>
      <p>The other day, I tried a new food —
      something deep-fried, coated in batter.</p>
      <p>It was quite delicious, and I liked it,
      but I couldn’t figure out what kind of meat was stuffed inside.</p>
      <p>Struggling for a long time, I finally realized:
      it was fish.</p>
      <p>Ah… I had forgotten.
      I’d even forgotten what fish tastes like.
      It’s not that I couldn’t remember;
      I had made myself forget.</p>
      <p>Wanting to swim to the other shore,
      I ended up deep under the ocean floor.</p>
      <p>The calluses on my feet —
      no matter how many times I clip them with nail clippers —
      they just keep growing back.</p>
      <p>Is life itself this hard already,
      or is there someone making it harder?</p>
      <p>If there is, cut them off.
      Cut off friends even.
      Cut off lovers either.</p>
      <p>For almost a whole lifetime,
      I never caught a single fish.</p>
      <p>Look — just when I was about to catch one,
      the whole universe was pulled up,
      and my fishing rod bent and became a rainbow.</p>
      <p>It was me who got caught, after all.</p>
